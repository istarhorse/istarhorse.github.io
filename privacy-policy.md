# Privacy Policy for Mans Calendar

**Effective Date**: June 10, 2025

## Introduction

Mans Calendar is a mobile application designed to help you privately track sexual activity, sexual partners, and store personal photos, with no social features. Your data remains accessible only to you. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information. Your privacy is our priority, and we are committed to safeguarding your data.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following data to provide the app’s features:

### User-Provided Information
- **Sexual Activity Data**: Dates, times, types of activities, and any notes you add.
- **Partner Information**: Names or identifiers you provide and other data about sexual partners.
- **Personal Photos**: Photos you upload to the app.
- **Other Inputs**: Any additional details you choose to enter.

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Device Information**: Device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.
- **Usage Data**: App interactions and feature usage statistics (e.g., frequency of use).
- **Error Reports**: Crash logs and performance metrics collected via an error reporting service for troubleshooting.

We do not collect IP addresses, precise location data, or other unnecessary information unless required for specific features or legal compliance.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your data to:
- Provide and personalize the app’s tracking and photo storage features.
- Generate anonymized, aggregated global charts of sexual activity trends (e.g., average or maximum activity over time), ensuring no individual user can be identified.
- Analyze app usage to improve performance and user experience.
- Respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and provide support.
- Comply with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests from authorities.

## Data Security

We protect your data with:
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption (AES-256) for activity logs, partner data, and photos; RSA-encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS for all client-server interactions.
- **Storage**: Encrypted databases and photo storage hosted on company-managed servers running Kubernetes clusters.
- **Access Controls**: Only you can access your personal data.

We regularly review our security practices to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except:
- **Service Providers**: We use cloud hosting, database management, and error reporting services to support app functionality. These providers are bound by contracts to protect your data and comply with privacy laws.
- **Legal Requirements**: To comply with legal obligations or protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property (e.g., responding to court orders).

## Global Sexual Activity Charts

Global charts display anonymized, aggregated trends (e.g., average or maximum sexual activity across users). We use industry-standard anonymization to ensure no individual user or their data can be identified.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your data only as long as you maintain an account or as required by law. You can delete all your data (activity logs, partner info, photos) via the app’s settings at any time. Deleted data is permanently removed from our systems, except for minimal anonymized data used in global charts.

## Your Choices and Rights

You have the following rights:
- **Access**: View or receive a copy of your personal data.
- **Correction**: Update inaccurate information within the app.
- **Deletion**: Delete your data or account entirely.

To exercise these rights or raise concerns, contact us at info@istarhorse.com.

## Age Restrictions

Mans Calendar is intended for users aged 18 and older due to its sensitive content. During signup, you must self-declare that you are at least 18. We do not knowingly collect data from users under 18.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **Cloud Hosting and Storage**: For hosting app resources and storing photos.
- **Database Management**: For securely storing user data.
- **Error Reporting**: For performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

These services are hosted on our company-managed servers running Kubernetes clusters where possible, and all providers are bound by strict data protection agreements. We do not sell your data or share it for marketing purposes.

## Legal Compliance

This Privacy Policy complies with applicable U.S. laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We do not sell your data, and you can opt out of any potential future data sharing via info@istarhorse.com. For users outside the U.S., we align with principles like those in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure global best practices.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you via email and/or in-app alerts of significant changes. The latest version is always available in the app, with the effective date noted above.
